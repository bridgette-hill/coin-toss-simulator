This code is a simple Python program that simulates a coin flip either once or numerous times. It generates random outcomes, counts how many time the coin flips, and displays the percentages of flips that were heads and tails. 

Feautures include: flipping a virtual coin, user-defined number of flips, randomized results using random.choice(), result counting using collections.Counter, percentage of heads vs tails,
and debug prints to help trace execution.

How it works: Program asks user how many times they want to flip the coin, the program validates the input to ensure it's a positive integer, program simulates that number of coin flips, 
program prints results along with percentages.
